         Lab 03 â€“ Finding Objects in Problem Domain
     Objectives
Introduction to Problem Domain
Find objects in problem domain 
Stakeholder of the Software
Prepare a list of objects 
Implementation of basic OO programming concepts
Introduction
A problem domain is the area of application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. Focusing on a problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. 
For example, when developing a system to measure good practice in medicine, carpet drawings at hospitals would not be included in the problem domain. In this example, the domain refers to relevant topics solely within the delimited area of interest: medicine.
Problem domain analysis is completely independent of solution domain constructs, and is therefore eminently reusable. Fundamentally, a video rental store is just a video rental store. The required workflow does not change, regardless of whether the solution is implemented with a spiral-bound notebook, or a distributed, peer-to-peer database solution.
Object Oriented Analysis
You need to find object of interest for your semester software project for the target problem domain. Any noun in the problem description is either attribute or an object that might be necessary to record. 
Stakeholders
Any person, another software or external services may be your stakeholders if they have directly or indirectly interest in your software solution. Focus specifically on roles people will play in your software.
 
Lab Tasks
Prepare a list of objects in your semester project
Describe how each object is related to your project, specially focus on their state change or any behavior they will have in your software.
Categorize them such that you can easily pick the object that will be used in the software solution
Add some state and behavior to those objects.
Find relationship among the objects and list them.
